###Walt Whitman###

##O Captain! My Captain!##

**_Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,_**

**_The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,_**

**_The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,_**

**_While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;_**

     **_But O heart! heart! heart!_**
     
       **_O the bleeding drops of red,_**
       
         **_Where on the deck my Captain lies,_**
         
            **_Fallen cold and dead._**
            

**_O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;_**

**_Rise up--for you the flag is flung--for you the bugle trills,_**


**_For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths--for you the shores a-crowding,_**


**_For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;_**

      **_Here Captain! dear father!_**
      
       **_This arm beneath your head!_**
       
       
        **_It is some dream that on the deck,_**
         
            **_You've fallen cold and dead._**

**_My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,_**

**_My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,_**

**_The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,_**

**_From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;_**

**_Exult O shores, and ring O bells!_**

       **_But I with mournful tread,_**
       
         **_Walk the deck my Captain lies,_**
         
           **_Fallen cold and dead._**
